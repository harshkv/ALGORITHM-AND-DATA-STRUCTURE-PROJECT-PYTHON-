# ALGORITHM-AND-DATA-STRUCTURE-PROJECT-PYTHON-
Implementation of Data Structures to find the shortest path from source to destination using :
-Spanning tree
-Minimum Spanning Tree
-Prim's Spanning Tree Algorithm
-Dijkstra's Algorithm

Analysis :
-The Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is the most commonly used to solve the single-source shortest path problem. By using Binary heap, the complexity can be improved
-Prim's (also known as Jarník's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph, this provides the cheapest approach.

The inputs are taken from the input file.
