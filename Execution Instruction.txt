The ocodes are executed using Python 3, in the system terminal.
There are 3 input files for undirected graph:
inp2_undirected.txt
inp2_undirected1.txt
inp2_undirected2.txt

There are 3 input for directed graphs:
inp1.txt
inp2.txt
inp3.txt

WE have 3 programs:
One for Dijkstra's Directed Graphs
One for Dijkstra's Undirected Graphs
and One for Prim's Algorithm

For DIJKSTRA'S DIRECTED GRAPH CODE:
The source is by default A and it tracks path to all other nodes,
in case it doesn't have a path its infinite. The source can be changed
in the code, while calling Dijkstra's. The code also displays each path
one by one from the node, takes the shortest, discards the other.
It might go in an infinite loop in case there is no path or its
not a connected node.

For DIJKSTRA'S UNDIRECTED GRAPH CODE:
The source is by default A and it tracks path to all other nodes,
in case it doesn't have a path its infinite.The source can be changed
in the code, while calling Dijkstra's.The code also displays each path
one by one from the node, takes the shortest, discards the other.
It might go in an infinite loop in case there is no path or its
not a connected node.

For Prims's Code:
It displays the path and spanning tree and the cost. Starts from
node A.

The folder of input must be placed in same as the python file.
